# My playground for PHP experiments 💡🌱🛠️

A website built to document and showcase my journey in learning and experimenting with PHP. This is where I explore new concepts, try out code snippets, and build small projects to solidify my understanding of PHP development.

## What to Expect

This repository contains the source code (HTML, CSS, and PHP files) for my website dedicated to PHP learning. You might find:

- 🧪 Various code experiments and tests.
- 🌱 Small learning projects and exercises.
- 🛠️ Attempts at implementing different PHP features and techniques.
- 💡 Demonstrations of concepts I'm currently exploring.

## Usage

This repository primarily serves as a showcase of my learning process. To view the experiments and projects, you can:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Acourages/Arshan_PHP.git](https://github.com/Acourages/Arshan_PHP.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Arshan_PHP
    ```

3.  Open the HTML files in your web browser to view the front-end aspects. For PHP code, you'll need a local PHP development environment (like XAMPP, MAMP, or a Docker setup) to execute the `.php` files.

## Technologies Used

- 🟢 PHP
- 🎨 HTML
- 🖌️ CSS
- ✨ (Optional) Any specific PHP libraries or frameworks you might be experimenting with (e.g., Symfony components, Laravel Breeze - list them here if applicable).

## License

This project is intended for personal learning and portfolio purposes. However, if you find any part of it useful, it is open-source and available under the **MIT License**.
